This website is a basic HTML project created to showcase my understanding of semantic HTML and other foundational web development concepts. It represents a promotional site for TechCon SoCal 2024, featuring well-structured sections like headers, navigation, main content, and a footer. The project uses proper HTML5 semantics such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> to ensure clarity, accessibility, and good coding practices. This site serves as a learning milestone and a demonstration of my progress in mastering the fundamentals of HTML.
